* _**On rhel-8,i created a directory named as `master` and then created one folder named as production on which jenkins will copy file and also created a Dockerfile in which i created my own customized image,from which container launched**.._

**Before starting anything on rhel-8,i started docker and jenkins services,because both docker and jenkins are running on the top of rhel-8 and also disabled firewalld**..
